OVERVIEW

Microsoft -a billion dollar company in the technology and software sector- is thinking about venturing into movie making. Microsoft is one of if not the biggest corporation in the computer industry valued at around $1785 billion.

They are mostly known for:

Windows operating system
Softwares like Microsoft Office
Edge internet browser
They have also ventured into the video gaming world through their Xbox gaming studio where they produce the worlds second most popular console among many other world reknowned games. It safe to say they are at the spearhead of technology as we traverse the computer age of technology.

Thus to keep in line with their ambition of dominating in all the sectors they venture, here is a proposal to show whether movie making is a viable branch to go into.

BUSINESS PROBLEM

Microsoft did not become a company worth 1,785,000,000,000 just by sheer luck. A lot of hard work, insightfullness and very intelligent business decisions are behind their success. Therefore we want to make sure them starting a studio will just be another example of a smart business decision.

So how do we make this a smart business decision by Microsoft? A decision that further increases the company's worth. How do we make sure Microsoft dominates the sector as they do in all others?.

Thus we see there are 2 major guidlines here; Can Microsoft make money making movies? and Can they be really good at making movies? (The second one increases the chances of the first one).

How do we go about achieving this?

1. We ensure the sector -from an economocal point of view- has enough potential to secure large profits.

2. What do we need to do to make popular movies? What do people like to see in the big cinema.

Microsoft wants to make popular movies, since popular movies means more peole watch and spend money ensuring a higher chance on return on investment

DATA

We got our data from the following independently run websites

* The Numbers
* BoxOfficeMojo
* RottenTomatoes
* MovieDB

These sites have a wide variety of data all concerning movies for an extended period. This data includes things like domestic gross, worldwide gross, year of release and popularity measures of a movie from both professional critics and the average movie-goer. All this is data that can help answer our questions above.

RESULTS

The average cost of movie production is around $31,500,000. Despite a large number of outliers most movies since 1940 have cost around this much to produce.

Profits and production costs of movies. Large profits were being made.
The average profit was $22billion. The spiral, in the end, is due tothe COVID-19 breakout that hit the industry hard.

These are the top-earning movie studios
The top 2 Buena Vista and Warner brothers earned an upside of $40,000,000,000 in an 8-year period. This is $5,000,000,000 a year.

Now that we have seen the top 10 studios, lets work with only those since that is where Microsoft will aim to be.

We see on average the big studios produce around 13 movies a year(the black line) which is what Microsoft would have to aim for.

These are the most common genres of movies in the last 20 years. We are working withthe assumption that the more common a genre is the more popular it also is.
Thus Microsoft will have to aim for genres like drama, comedy, romance and action-adventure to increase chances of their movies being popular.

Movies in english seem to be predominant and so Microsoft should aim to make English movies but this also shows the potential markerts that Microsoft could target as there is a clear lack of representation among these other languages. This representation would increase the reach of their movies among the speakers of such languages. This will result in Microsoft being seen as inclusive which is a very good image to have in this day and age and will aid in popularity for movies associated with them.

We can see that movies released at the tail end of the year tend to have a higher average rating so this can be used as a guide for when to release movies to increase chances of it gaining popularity. This could possibly be due to the holiday season at the end of the year.

CONCLUSIONS

Let us recall our 2 guidline questions:

1. We ensure the sector -from an economocal point of view- has enough potential to secure large profits.

2. What do we need to do to make popular movies? What do people like to see in the big cinema.

We found that the average profit made from movies is around $22 billion:This shows that the sector has enough weight for Microsoft to invest in and expect really good returns.
This was further clarified by showing that the top studios earn around $5 billion a year from their movies.

In short,YES there is money to be made in movie making especially considering the average movie costs $30 million to make.

For the second question,if Micrososft want to make popular movies they should aim to make at least 13 movies a year as a studio in the following genres:
 * Drama
 * Comedy
 * Drama Mystery
 * Comedy Romance
 * Horror
These were found to be the most common genres movies are made in, thus if Microsoft can do the same and make similar or combinations of the above genres, this will increase the posibility of success in terms of popularity.

In adition Microsoft should aim to release their 'big hitters' at the tail end of the year since it is seen as though movies released at this time tend to have a higher voting average from the watchers.

NEXT STEPS

Further analyses should be carried out to find out:

* What directors and actors, increase the chances of a movie to be a success.
* The corelation between a movie's production cost and its popularity.
* Predicting the most likely challenges to be faced when setting up.
